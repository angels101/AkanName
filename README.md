##  Akan Naming System
This repository contains code for my Akan Naming System/Application.
### By Arthur Earl
## Description.
Project, a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
  Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
 children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

## BDD
-Enter your birth details
You will inpute your details by typing or by clicking on the provided pop up calender
-Choose your gender either Male or Female field provided since your Akan name will be outputed only when you have provided the gender and your Akan
name will be outputed only when you have provided the gender and your valid dates so you need to understand that the gender section is important.
-The submit button is the part where your input or your details have been fed to the application and then it displays or outputs your Akan name and the day
you were born in case you forget to select gender. The gender section is very crucial and it won't be ommited by the system so, its crucial to select the lower section.
-The Pop-up window will display your name at the top of the window, then you will click Ok.
